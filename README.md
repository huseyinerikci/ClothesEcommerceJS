# Clothes E-commerce Website

This project is an application that I developed using HTML, CSS and JavaScript for a basic e-commerce site. The project offers users functionality such as adding products to the cart, editing the contents of the cart and calculating the total price. It also offers a mobile-friendly experience with its responsive design.
